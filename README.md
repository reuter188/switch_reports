# switch_reports
Simple report generator for SWITCH

No interface is yet built. You need a text editor/IDE to modify the script in order to use the different functions. Comments in the script will guide you through usage.

Python 3.10 required. Run:

pip install requirements.txt

Install pdflatex and make sure the compiler is in the system PATH variable.

The report will be saved in the same absolute path where the script is running. Move the file elsewhere or rename it to save before running the script again, otherwise it will be overwritten.

To modify the apperence of the final report edit the report_template.tex file.
